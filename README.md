# Harmonizing with Machines: A Quantitative Exploration of AI's Representation in German Music Media

## Abstract
In the zeitgeist of the 21st century, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a focal point of discussions across various domains, from its applications in everyday life to its implications in creative fields. The music industry, often at the vanguard of technological integration, has not remained untouched. This empirical study delves into the portrayal of AI in German music-focused print media between 2016 and 2022, a period marked by significant advancements in AI, including its foray into artistic creations. Through a quantitative content analysis of 18,486 articles from prominent music publications, a mere 0.3% were found to engage with the topic of AI. The data reveals a noticeable uptick in such articles from 2019 onward. Employing the frames of Framing Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study elucidates the multifaceted perceptions and evaluations of AI. Preliminary findings indicate a predominantly neutral stance, with variations across different magazines. Furthermore, the study aims to enrich the discourse by incorporating additional data from popular music magazines. This research not only uncovers the music industry's engagement with AI but also offers insights into broader societal attitudes towards this disruptive technology within a creative realm.
